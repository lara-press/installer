# LaraPress Installer

1. Add this repository to the global composer.json. (Since this is a fork, it's not on packagist).

```
"repositories": [
    {   
        "url": "https://github.com/lara-press/installer.git",
        "type": "git"
    }   
]
```

2. Then run `composer require lara-press/installer`.

3. After that, create a new LaraPress project with `larapress new blog`!
